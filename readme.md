**REST API application**   

A voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

 * 2 types of users: admin and regular users
 * Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
 * Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
 * Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
 * Only one vote counted per user
 * If user votes again the same day:
    - If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed

Each restaurant provides new menu each day.

All changes in the database can only be done by admin. 
Links vary depending on which user requests information.
